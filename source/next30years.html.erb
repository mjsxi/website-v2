    <p>This piece is a forecast of gaming over the next 30 years; highlighting how it will influence other parts of culture. We wanted the design to be as striking as the illustrations. Youâ€™ll notice subtle interaction occurs as you scroll through. This creates a fun interactivity which mimics the content of the story.</p>
