    <p>Smiling can make all the difference, and we noticed there wasnâ€™t enough smiling happening in Philadelphia. We set out to change peoples moods through an installation about what makes different people smile, by asking them to write one thing down on a post it note that makes them smile. All the responses were hung up for other people to read and enjoy.</p>
