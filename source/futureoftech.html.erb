    <p>My senior thesis took a look into the future and how technology would grow to be a part of us. I was fascinated by the way we use the internet to connect with others and how it benefits people to be able to connect with a loved one from the other side of the country. My main focus was a wearable that pulsed in sync with a loved ones heart and how even though they might not be with us at that moment we are always together.</p>

    <p>The little trinkets I came up with also assisted in everyday life, my helping you keep a schedule get notifications and interact smartly with your surroundings.</p>
