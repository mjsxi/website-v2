    <p>Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) in Philadelphia attempts to promote business growth by providing tax and business incentives. This was among my first projects in my design career. The city wanted a digital-only booklet that could be downloaded, they enjoyed the design so much that they eventually had a limited print version available.</p>
