    <p>Delicate situations are often a touchy subject, usually the people involved feel somewhat awkward to come clean. This is the driving idea behind “The Know”, starting as a way for young people to come out of the closet evolved into a means for conveying news the giver feels uneasy talking about to the recipient. The end goal is to hand off the glass vase as a sort of vessel for the news to travel to the persons involved.</p>
