  <div class="m-project s3">
    <p>I’m Matt Sullivan; recent Industrial Design grad.</p>

    <p>I'm a learning junkie, always poking around to gain a new skill; I am never happy just resting on what I know. I love to further myself both technically and educationally.</p>

    <p>I currently work for <a href="">Vox Media</a>. They are a new media company that let me satisfy my creative itch by letting me participate in a veriety of design projects. Current <a href="">Voxaholic</a> former <a href="">Polynaut</a> and <a href="">Verger</a>.</p>
