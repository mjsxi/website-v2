      <p>Iâ€™m Matt Sullivan; current product designer at <%= link_to 'Vox Media', 'http://www.voxmedia.com/' %>.</p>

      <p>I'm a learning junkie, always poking around to gain a new skill. I'm never happy just resting on what I know. I love to further myself both technically and educationally.</p>

      <p>Vox is a new media company that lets me satisfy my creative itch by inviting me to participate in a variety of design projects. Current <%= link_to 'Voxaholic', 'http://www.vox.com/' %>, former <%= link_to 'Polynaut', 'http://www.polygon.com/' %> and <%= link_to 'Verger', 'http://www.theverge.com/' %>.</p>

      <p>Want to work together? <%= link_to 'Email', 'mailto:matt.sullivan@sbnation.com' %> me.</p>
